    # Introduction to AI and Machine learning
    This course is an introduction to machine learning through digital image processing. I've learned that machine learning is the study of how a computer learns to perform tasks without precoding instructions, which is accomplished by implementing a neural network. Our task is to pass image data to the provided neural network to create an accurate image processing model.
