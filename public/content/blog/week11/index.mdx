    # Test
    n this lesson, we collaborate with another student to accomplish a three-level robot challenge. We create a robot using an Arduino as the microcontroller. The first goal is to utilize a sensor to prevent the robot from colliding with walls as it walks. The second purpose is to use a sensor to guide a robot to all of its targets. Thirdly, the robot must walk without a sensor and without colliding with any impediments.
