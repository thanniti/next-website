# Computer Network
The TCP/IP protocol enabled computers to exchange data regardless of physical distance and at any time; nevertheless, this comes with the risk of data leaking or being intercepted by an unwanted entity. We are now encoding our transmitted data using the RSA algorithm. Nonetheless, the threats posed by hackers persist today, with new methods of hacking or exploiting being developed, which is why it is critical for programmers to learn about cybersecurity.
