<Section>
   In this session, I was able to understand the fundamentals of circuits and circuit connections, including resistance, current, and voltage calculations, as well as fundamental electronic parts such as LEDs, capacitors, and resistors. Besides that, there is a simple curcuit simulationÂ lesson for the TinkerCAD software.

## Definition
<Figure image="tinker-circuit.png" width="50%" imageCaption="circuit"/>
In electronics, a circuit is a complete circular path that electricity flows through. A simple circuit consists of a current source, conductors and a load. The term circuit can be used in a general sense to refer to any fixed path that electricity, data or a signal can travel through.
## Resistor

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. Moreover, resistance follow the Ohm's rule which voltage are poportion to current times resistance (V=IR)
