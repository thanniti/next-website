# What is Engineering Modeling?
<Figure image="modeling.jpg" width="50%" imageCaption="modeling"/>
Generally speaking, a model is a depiction of anything. It could be a smaller version of something that already exists or a miniature version of something that you intend to develop on a larger scale. A model may be a simplified version containing the basic components of something more complex. A model may be a physical depiction of an idea.

The purpose of engineering models is to study a real engineering problem. The outcomes are generally applicable and reliable for the construction of the full-scale object, assembly, or system. Frequently, engineering models are simple, affordable, simple to create, and can be assembled rapidly. Often, it is more cost-effective to do preliminary testing on a model than to produce the actual item. Numerous designs originate from theory. A model can demonstrate how the design will function in real-world settings.

# 3D Printer

A 3D printer is a machine that uses polymers to print 3D models.
- Turn on the printer
- Upload the model's file
- Start printing
- After printing is completed, Carefully remove the finished model.
