## The Summer Of Math Exposition
Intended to encourage more people to put out explainers of math online. Three Blue One Brown and his team organize a competition where anyone can submit a video, blog post, interactive game, or whatever else they dream up,
on a math topic. 

## Our progress
To commence, Although math is a vast subject, we all unanimously agreed on the ”Essence of Limit“ topic, despite the fact that we had just finished the first calculus lesson in our math class. As we get started, my primary role is to program the animation, and by utilizing Manim (the mathematical animation engine), it facilitates coding the whole animation in Python. Nonetheless, it remains an affliction, given that I am not yet proficient with this tool. However, because I had worked through 3000 lines of code, I was able to finish the video on time.
