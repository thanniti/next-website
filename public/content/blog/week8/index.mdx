    In this class, I learned how to create games with the Unity software. 3D games are primarily composed of code that controls various functions of the game, including camera angles and 3D models. The engine will render every component in a coded format and must be interactive with the player. With tools like Unity, we can download game assets such as maps or preliminary models, making game creation much easier.
